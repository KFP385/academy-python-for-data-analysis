# Python for Data Analysis

## Overview

This two-day training provides a practical introduction to Python and its core capabilities for data analysis.

## Working with the project

### 1. Open the Codespace

1. Log in to Github - create one if you haven't already
2. Click the green **‘Code’** button on the GitHub repository page  
3. Select **‘Codespaces’** → **‘Create codespace on main’**

This will launch a new **Codespace**, a cloud-based development environment pre-configured with all necessary packages and files for the training.

### 2. Start working in the Codespace

Once the Codespace has launched:

1. Wait for the Codespace to fully initialise, this will take about 3 minutes on the first set up.
   
2. Close the Terminal and open the notebook(s) listed in the training agenda and start working through the exercises.

> All necessary libraries should already be installed. If you encounter a missing package, use `pip install package_name`.

## Agenda - Python for Data Analysis Training

### Day 1: Python Essentials

- Understand the different data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists  
- Use conditionals to execute code only under certain conditions  
- Write `for` loops to repeat code segments  
- Create reusable functions with parameters to apply logic flexibly  

### Day 2: Data Analysis with pandas

- Gather descriptive summary statistics of your data with simple operations  
- Effectively select and filter parts of your dataset  
- Retrieve advanced statistics with `groupby` aggregations  
- Create new columns using `.assign()`
